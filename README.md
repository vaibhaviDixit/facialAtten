# Facial Attendance System
This project implements a facial attendance system using the face_recognition library in Python. It captures images from a camera, detects faces, recognizes known faces, and logs attendance in a CSV file.

## Features
+ Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV.
+ Face Recognition: Recognizes known faces using the face_recognition library.
+ Attendance Logging: Logs attendance with timestamps in a CSV file.
+ Simple Interface: Provides a basic command-line interface for operation.

## Technologies Used
+ Python: Programming language used for the implementation.
Libraries:
+ face_recognition: For face detection and recognition.
+ cv2 (OpenCV): For capturing images and real-time video processing.
+ numpy: For numerical operations.
+ CSV: For storing attendance records.
